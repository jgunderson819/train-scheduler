This project is a train scheduler where you can create new trains and it will keep track of all of them and let you know when each subsequent train will arrive.  It was challenging.  We had to utilile firebase to store the information online so it can be used at different places simultaneously, had to use momentjs to do time calculations and the program does many calculations and keeps track of differing items all simtaneously.  It was a very helpful assignment to understand many different programming aspects.
